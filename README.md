# This IoT system is an end-to-end data route with visualization from sensors to storage.

## Phase 1 *Available now - Sensor to Data Visualization and Storage âœ…



### This project (P1) helps developers prototype and publish sensor-driven (Apps) in augmented reality using Unity, Firebase and Google Cloud. 


P1.0 - Starter Project (Planter AI) + Unity 3D + Firebase + Google Cloud.

We've developed a sensor application (Python + Raspberry Pi + Arduino)

Stored the Python + Raspberry Pi data into Google Firebase through Python API's

Collected data from Firebase and displayed it in a Unity mobile application.

Displayed data on a static IP address from Firebase.

## Phase 2 Sensor to Hyperledger and Blockchain Storage with Visualization *Pending release :cyclone:
### This project (P2) helps developers prototype and publish sensor-driven (dApps) in augmented reality using Mobile Native, AWS, Hyperledger, and Cardano. 

P2.0 - Starter Project (Planter AI) + CrossPlatform Apps + AWS & Hyperledger + Blockchain Storage.

Phase 2.0  - In Development.

{Mobile dApp Development & Uploading to snapcraft.io, The App Store and Google Play using Augmented Reality (AR), AWS (Amazon Web Server & Services) + Hyperledger & Cardano} *Contact us for specifics using support@wolfberryllc.com - otherwise we will release all phase 2 assets, source code + notes around December 01 2022



## Phase 3 Management and Response System *Pending release ðŸŒ€
### This phase updates the backend to use Azure to Hyperledger to blockchain storage. 
A wallet management and response system using phase 2 will be completed in this new environment.
